# enercast -- Electrical energy forecast tools

Electricity is a key energy component of modern societies. Accurate predictions helps 
electricity agents to reduce production costs, optimize the use of natural ressources,
take avantage of market opportunities among other benefits.

Industry and academia have collaborate for years now, producing a vast set of models
and data analysis tools. However, electrical systems have their own characterics that
may vary from one system to another. 

This R package is the result of adapting and extending some of the predictions models
existent in literature for the Uruguayan electrical system.
